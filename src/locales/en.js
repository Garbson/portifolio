    title: "About Me",
    description: `
    üëã Hello, I'm Garbson Souza Santos, a front-end developer passionate about creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
    With a solid foundation in modern technologies like Vue.js, Quasar, Node.js, Nuxt.js, Vuex, and Pinia, I turn ideas into
    exceptional digital experiences. üí° Since I was 16, I've been diving deep into the world of programming, accumulating vast
    experience in freelance projects spanning different sectors and geographies. I've worked with an American company developing
    innovative solutions, collaborated with biotech companies, and even contributed to a hotel in Cusco, Peru, always focused on
    delivering high-quality, value-added products. üåç Currently, I work as a developer for Hellenic Technologies, a Greek company,
    and for KNN Group, where I continue to apply and expand my skills. My expertise includes consuming APIs to create robust and
    responsive web applications, ensuring optimized performance and an excellent user experience (UX). üöÄ Alongside my practical
    experience, I'm studying Information Systems at the Federal University of Acre, which allows me to align theoretical and practical
    knowledge while staying updated with the latest trends and innovations in the technology market. üéì
